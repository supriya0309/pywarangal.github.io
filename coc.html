        <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
        <p>The purpose of our Community Code of Conduct is to ensure that all  participants in Pywarangal community have the best possible experience.  We are all here to help each other learn,nowadays technical learning aspects are passionating the generation. It helps togrow our skillsets and have a  good time!</p>
        <p>Pywarangal Community Code of Conduct covers our  behavior as members of the community, in any forum, mailing  list, wiki, web site, code repository, IRC channel, private  correspondence, or public meetings.</p>
        <p>working as a community, diversity is one of our  huge strengths. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people  to adhere to, to ensure that the Pywarangal community continues to be an  excellent space in which to communicate, collaborate, and contribute.</p>
        <p>This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you  can't do. everything is possible with determination and hardwork. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended — a guide  to make it easier to be excellent to each other. We expect it to be  followed in spirit as much as in the letter.</p>
        <p>Pywarangal community members strive to
          <ul>
            <li><span>Be friendly, patient and welcoming.</span> We strive  to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds  and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any  race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status,  social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation,  gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political  belief, religion and mental and physical ability.</li>
            <li><span>Be considerate.</span> Our work will be used by other  people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision  we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should take those  consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a  world-wide community and we have a global base of users and of  contributors. Even if it's not obvious at the time, our contributions to  the python project will impact the work of others.</li>
            <li><span>Be respectful.</span> Not all of us will agree all the  time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners.  We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot  allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to  remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened  is not a productive one. Members of the Pywaranagal community should be  respectful when dealing with other contributors as well as with people  outside of the project and with users of the project.</li>
            <li><span>Collaborate openly.</span> Collaboration is central to the Pywarangal and to the larger free software community. This  collaboration involves individuals working within teams, cross-project  collaboration within the Pywarangal community and working with other  projects outside of the Pywaranagal community. This collaboration reduces  redundancy, and improves the quality of our work. Internally and  externally, we should always be open to collaboration. Wherever  possible, we should work closely with upstream and downstream projects  and others in the free software community to coordinate our technical,  advocacy, documentation and other work. Our work should be done  transparently and we should involve as many interested parties as early  as possible. If we decide to take a different approach than others, we  will let them know early, document our work and inform others regularly  of our progress. We do not create private forms of communication that  take away transparency or exclude other contributors and collaborators.</li>
            <li><span>When we disagree, try to understand why.</span>  Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and the  Pywarangal community is no exception. It is important that we resolve  disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re  different. The strength of the PyDelhi community comes from its varied  community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people  have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why  someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Focus on  helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes. It is important  that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively and  with the help of the community and community processes. When our goals differ dramatically, we encourage the  creation of alternative implementations, so that the community can test  new ideas and contribute to the discussion.</li>
            <li><span>When we are unsure, we ask for help.</span> Nobody knows  everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in the PyDelhi community. Asking questions avoids many problems down the road, and so  questions are encouraged. Those who are asked questions should be  responsive and helpful. However, when asking a question, care must be  taken to do so in an appropriate forum.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>We take the following very seriously, and any violations may impact your ability to participate in  community. <span>Be careful with your words and actions you perform.</span> We are a  community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Do  not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other  exclusionary behavior is not acceptable and should be reported immediately. This  includes but is not limited to:
          <ul>
            <li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
            <li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
            <li>Posting sexually suggestive, explicit or violent material.</li>
            <li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").</li>
            <li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
            <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
            <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
            <li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
